# 📝 Pastry

This project is **inspired by rentry**, a simple and elegant pastebin service. It provides a clean interface for creating and sharing text pastes anonymously, with support for both **permanent (passcode-protected)** and **shared guest pastes**. Built with React and Neon Database, it offers a modern, responsive experience for quick text sharing. 🚀

To run the project, first ensure you have **Node.js** installed. Then, navigate to the project directory, install dependencies with `npm install`, and start the development server with `npm run dev`. The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

To use it, visit the homepage and choose between:
- **Admin mode**: Enter a passcode for permanent pastes 🔒
- **Guest mode**: Shared editable paste for all users 👥

Create or edit pastes in the editor, save them, and share the generated URLs. Guests can view and edit the same shared paste collaboratively. 📤
